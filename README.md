# NeobankAnalysis
Explore the realms of a globally renowned neo-bank, pioneering in eradicating hidden bank charges for cross-currency transactions.

Intriguingly, the neo-bank seeks to fathom the dynamics of user retention and gauge user engagement based on their activities.

Your mission: Unveil insights, provide shrewd business recommendations to abate churn rates, and illuminate pathways to heightened user involvement.

For this project, I used the following tools:

SQL: To source, clean, and transform data;
Python: To transform and visualize data, including creating a retention matrix;
Excel: To visualize and edit the retention matrix, as it provides control over each cell;
Power BI: To create visualizations and further source, clean, and transform data.
